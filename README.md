# Flow Master

## Application introduction

Flow Master is a web-based application that provides AI-powered project management boards. It seamlessly integrates into workflow and utilizes state-of-the-art models to summarize ticket descriptions, autonomously assign story points, and intelligently allocate tasks to developers based on their skills and workload. With an intuitive UI, Scrum Masters can easily create, manage, and track tickets, visualizing progress as they drag tasks across the board. Moreover, the tool also helps with sprint retrospective meetings by providing dynamic graphs and insights into pending story points for each developer.
